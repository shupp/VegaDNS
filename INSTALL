BEFORE YOU INSTALL

*   make sure php has support for mysql.  On Debian, for example, this would
    be the php5-mysql package.
*   make sure wget is installed (http://www.gnu.org/directory/wget.html).
    Many distributions already have this installed.  wget is used for importing
    via AXFR, and also for dumping the SQL records to the djbdns data file.
    wget must be within the webserver's PATH environment
*   make sure MySQL is installed, and that you have an account/database for
    vegadns,  or the ability to create an account and database.  Again, many
    distributions already have this installed.
*   make sure djbdns (http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html), ucspi-tcp
    (http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp.html), and  daemontools
    (http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/install.html) are all installed.
*   make sure you create the djbdns accounts Gtinydns and Gdnslog for later use.

INSTALL VegaDNS

NOTE:   The Following steps assume your ServerRoot is /usr/local/apache, and
        that your daemontools service directory is /service.

        Please substitute the appropriate paths if necessary.

        Likewise, you should substitue "myserver" for your real hostname, and
        x.x in "vegadns-x.x" with the version of VegaDNS you are using.

1.  Change into your web server's DocumentRoot  like so:

    cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/

2.  Get and unpack vegadns source:

    wget www.vegadns.org/download/vegadns-current.tgz
    tar -xzf vegadns-current.tgz

3.  Setup SQL account (replace 'secret' below with your desired password):

    mysqladmin -u root create vegadns -p
    mysql -u root -e "GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER ON vegadns.* TO vegadns@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'secret'" mysql -p

4.  Create the private vegadns directories for templates, sessions in your
    web server's ServerRoot, and have them owned by the user/group that the
    web server runs as (nobody:nobody in this example)

    mkdir -p /usr/local/apache/vegadns/templates_c
    mkdir /usr/local/apache/vegadns/configs
    mkdir /usr/local/apache/vegadns/cache
    mkdir /usr/local/apache/vegadns/sessions

    chown -R nobody:nobody /usr/local/apache/vegadns
    chmod -R 770 /usr/local/apache/vegadns

5.  Edit the vegadns-x.x/src/config.php file.  Make *sure* that the
    "private_dirs" variable is set properly, as well as the MySQL account
    information, and and also the "vegadns_url" variable.

6.  Create a tinydns service on 127.0.0.1 for testing

    tinydns-conf Gtinydns Gdnslog /etc/tinydns 127.0.0.1
    ln -s /etc/tinydns /service

7.  Log into VegaDNS for the first time to create the tables, and update the
    default login information by pointing your web browser to:

    http://myserver/vegadns-x.x/

    The default admin login is email "test@test.com", password "test"

    Next, you should edit "default_records" so that new domains have the proper
    SOA record, and that they have name servers, etc.  Once this is done, you
    can add or import a domain, then setup the data dumps in the next step.

8.  To install the update-data.sh script (currently located in the root
    directory of vegadns), you will need to first edit the VEGADNS variable to
    point to the correct url.  You may also need to update the TINYDNSDIR
    variable if you used something other than /etc/tinydns.

    Try exectuting the update-data.sh shell script.  Once you confirm that
    this is working correctly, move update-data.sh to /usr/local/sbin/ and then
    add it to cron to run every 10 minutes or so, whatever is appropriate.
    You'll an entry to your crontab like so:

    # Update tinydns with VegaDNS data
    */10 * * * * /usr/local/sbin/update-data.sh

    NOTE: If intend to run update_data.sh from an IP other than 127.0.0.1, then
    you will need to add that IP to $trusted_hosts in config.php

    Done!

    To report success:
    % ( echo 'First M. Last'; echo `uname -a` ) | mail hostmaster@shupp.org


NOTE ON AXFR

    To use the Import domains via AXFR, you must first setup the remote host to
    allow AXFR request from this machine.  Note that if your VegaDNS machine
    has multiple IP addresses, that you allow AXFR from the same IP that the
    outbound request is made.  Look in the logs of the remote server if you
    are having problems connecting.

NOTE on IPv6

    IPv6 support is disabled by default.  To enable it, set $use_ipv6 to true in
    src/config.php.  This will allow you to create AAAA records using the generic
    record syntax.  You may also create automatic PTR records for your AAAA records
    by choosing the AAAA+PTR record.  This will generate the matching PTR record
    during export from the database.  Note that if you use AAAA+PTR, tinydns will
    not respond to PTR requests unless you separately add SOA and NS records for the
    ip6.arpa domain.
